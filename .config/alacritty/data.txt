To change your background to black, you should modify the value for background under the [colors.primary] section in your color.toml file. Here's the line you need to change:

toml
Copy code
background = "0x000000"
So your updated [colors.primary] section will look like this:

toml
Copy code
[colors.primary]
background = "0x000000"
foreground = "0xebdbb2"
This will set the background color to black. After making this change, save the file and restart Alacritty for the changes to take effect.

what does foreground do

The foreground setting in your colorscheme file defines the color of the text and other elements displayed in the terminal. Essentially, it's the color that will be applied to the text you type or see in the terminal window.

In your case, with the line:

toml
Copy code
foreground = "0xebdbb2"
the text will be displayed in a light beige color (the Gruvbox light color). Adjusting this color can enhance readability, especially against the background color you choose. If you set the background to black, you might want to keep a high-contrast foreground color for better visibility.
